## Description

Please consult the file [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) in this directory for
installation instructions.

The [`oomph-lib` homepage](http://www.oomph-lib.org) provides much more detail on
installation instructions, tutorials, and licencing information. Provided you
have downloaded a distribution that contains the documentation and you have the
required tools (mainly `doxygen`; get it from [here](http://www.doxygen.org))
available on your machine, the installation procedure will create a local copy
of the `oomph-lib` webpages and the entire online documentation in the `doc`
directory. In particular, `doc/html/index.html` is a local copy of the `oomph-lib`
homepage.
