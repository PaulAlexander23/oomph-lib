As with the 2D case, here we include the same eigensolution through a scaling variable \f$c\f$.
The same eigensolution can be used as this is the correct behaviour of the singularity in the limit as we approach the problematic corner.
The eigensolution will not satisfy the bulk equations however and so we must account for this too.

Previously <A HREF="classoomph_1_1MyElement.html"> MyElement </A> were used within the bulk to include the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations, store the estimate of the error and region id and override the output function. 

These are upgraded to <A HREF="classoomph_1_1SingularAxisymNavierStokesElement.html"> SingularAxisymNavierStokesElement<MyElement> </A> to allow them to be augmented to include the singularity component.
The augmented equations are given by the following:

\f[ u = c \bar{u} + \tilde{u} \f]
