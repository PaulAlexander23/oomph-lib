\section correction Natural boundary condition matching

By include the \f$c \nabla \cdot \bar{\tau}\f$ within the bulk, the natural boundary condition at the interior becomes 
\f[c {t} \cdot \bar{\tau} \cdot {n} + {t} \cdot \tilde{\tau} \cdot {n} = {t} \cdot {\tau} \cdot {n}.\f]
The equations in the in the bulk \f$\Omega\f$, are then,
\f[c \nabla\bar{u} + \nabla \cdot \tilde{u} = 0,\ c \nabla \cdot \bar{\tau} + \nabla \cdot \tilde{\tau} = 0.\f]
This can be done by enabling the appropriate flag in the <A HREF="classoomph_1_1SingularAxisymNavierStokesElement.html">SingularAxisymNavierStokesElement</A>.

The other consequence is that we do not need to add the additional stress contributions at the boundary too, otherwise the procedure is unchanged.

This is implemented in the <A HREF="classoomph_1_1SingularAxisymSectorProblem.html"> SingularAxisymSectorProblem </A> class and in the <A HREF="classoomph_1_1SingularRegionAxisymSectorProblem.html"> SingularRegionAxisymSectorProblem </A> class.
