\mainpage Axisymmetric Stokes flow with an obtuse corner

See also the 2D Stokes flow in an obtuse corner.

\section no-correction Without correction

We define our sector domain so that it has radius \f$R\f$ and interior angle \f$\alpha\f$. One straight side is aligned with the vertical with the azimuthal angle varying counter clockwise through to \f$\alpha\f$. The corner is located at (x,y) = (1,0) and \f$R < 1\f$.
In the bulk \f$\Omega\f$, we have the Stokes equations,
\f[\nabla \cdot u = 0,\ \nabla \cdot \tau = 0.\f]
where \f$\tau = -p I + \nabla \otimes u + (\nabla \otimes u)^T\f$.
On the vertical boundary, \f$S_0\f$,
\f[u \cdot n                 = 0,\ {t} \cdot {\tau} \cdot {n}  = \frac{1}{l} \left({u}\cdot {t} - 1\right).\f]
where \f$l\f$ is the slip length and we have non-dimensionalised the system such that the wall velocity is unity.

On the diagonal boundary, \f$S_2\f$, we have no penetration and pure slip, or equivalently, a tangential stress free condition.
\f[{u} \cdot {n}                 = 0 , {t} \cdot {\tau} \cdot {n}  = 0.\f]

On the curved far field boundary, \f$S_1\f$, we employ the natural boundary condition to give a free stress constraint,
\f[ {\tau} \cdot {n}  = 0.\f]
The pressure at the top of the sector is set to zero, at \f$x = 0, z = R\f$,
\f[p = 0.\f]

\section lagrange Lagrange multipliers

The no-penetration conditions are imposed via Lagrange multipliers.
On the vertical boundary, \f$S_0\f$,
\f[\tau \cdot n = \lambda_1 n\f]
On the diagonal boundary, \f$S_2\f$,
\f[\tau \cdot n = \lambda_2 n\f]

\section implementation Implementation


The equations in the bulk are implemented with using `TTaylorHoodElement<2>`s.
The no-penetration conditions are imposed through `ImposeImpenetrabilityElement`s.
The far field conditions are imposed through new `FarFieldElement`s.
The slip condition is imposed through `NavierStokesSlipElement`s.

I am using a separate submesh for each of the conditions on the different boundaries.
The Lagrange multipliers get stored by adding additional dofs to the nodes and using the velocities interpolation strategy.
This is done in a way such that there can be multiple distinct Lagrange multipliers at corner nodes e.g. \f$\lambda_1\f$ and \f$\lambda_2\f$.

\section correction With correction

We include the singular eigensolution through an additional degree of freedom, \f$c\f$, which determines its scaling.
\f[ u = c \bar{u} + \tilde{u} \f]
\f[ p = \tilde{p} \f]
\f[ \tau = c \bar{\tau} + \tilde{\tau} \f]
Noting that \f$\bar{p} = 0\f$.
The system of equations, now expressed in terms of \f$c, \bar{*}, \tilde{*}\f$ is given by:
In the bulk \f$\Omega\f$, we have the Stokes equations,
\f[c \nabla\bar{u} + \nabla \cdot \tilde{u} = 0,\ c \nabla \cdot \bar{\tau} + \nabla \cdot \tilde{\tau} = 0.\f]
(By include the \f$c \nabla \cdot \bar{\tau}\f$ within the bulk,  the natural boundary condition becomes \f$c {t} \cdot \bar{\tau} \cdot {n} + {t} \cdot \tilde{\tau} \cdot {n}\f$ which matches \f${t} \cdot {\tau} \cdot {n}\f$ at the interior boundary.)
The expressions for the additional terms are given by the [[axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations]] with the bars substituted in.
And the total velocity equations,
\f[ u = c \bar{u} + \tilde{u} \f]
On the vertical boundary, \f$S_0\f$,
\f[\tilde{u} \cdot n                 = 0,\ c {t} \cdot \bar{\tau} \cdot {n} + {t} \cdot \tilde{\tau} \cdot {n}  = \frac{1}{l} \left(\tilde{u}\cdot {t} - 1\right) + \frac{c}{l} \bar{u}\cdot {t}.\f]
where \f$l\f$ is the slip length and we have non-dimensionalised the system such that the wall velocity is unity.

On the diagonal boundary, \f$S_2\f$, we have no penetration and pure slip, or equivalently, a tangential stress free condition.
\f[\tilde{u} \cdot {n}                 = 0 , c {t} \cdot \bar{\tau} \cdot {n} + {t} \cdot \tilde{\tau} \cdot {n}  = 0.\f]
On the curved far field boundary, \f$S_1\f$, we employ the following condition,
\f[c (\bar{\tau} \cdot n) + \tilde{\tau} \cdot {n} = 0.\f]
The pressure at the top of the sector is set to zero, at \f$x = 0, z = R\f$,
\f[\tilde{p} = 0.\f]

Additionally we would like to impose  \f$\lim_{\rho \to 0} \partial{p}/\partial{\theta} = 0\f$, however due the discrete mesh coordinates we impose the following instead,
\f[p(\epsilon,0) = p(\epsilon,\alpha)\f]
where \f$\epsilon \ll 1\f$ and polar coordinates are used.

\section lagrange2 Lagrange multipliers

The Lagrange multipliers remain the same but are imposed on \f$\tilde{u}\f$ instead of \f$u\f$.
