@I w 0.71\textwidth figure1 "The sector domain."


We define our sector domain so that it has radius \f$R\f$ and interior angle \f$\alpha\f$.
One straight side is aligned with the vertical with the azimuthal angle varying counter clockwise through to \f$\alpha\f$.
The corner is located at (x,y) = (1,0) and \f$R < 1\f$, so that the line of rotation does not cross through the domain.

In the bulk \f$\Omega\f$, we have the Stokes equations in axisymmetric coordinates, written here in stress tensor form,
\f[\nabla \cdot u = 0,\ \nabla \cdot \tau = 0.\f]
where \f$\tau = -p I + \nabla \otimes u + (\nabla \otimes u)^T\f$.
These are implemented in the <A HREF="classoomph_1_1MyElement.html"> MyElement </A> class.

On the vertical boundary, \f$S_0\f$,
\f[u \cdot n                 = 0,\ {t} \cdot {\tau} \cdot {n}  = \frac{1}{l} \left({u}\cdot {t} - 1\right).\f]
where \f$l\f$ is the slip length and we have non-dimensionalised the system such that the wall velocity is unity.
The no penetration condition is imposed through a Lagrange multiplier, \f$\lambda_1\f$, using <A HREF="classoomph_1_1ImposeImpenetrabilityElement.html"> ImposeImpenetrabilityElement</A>s. 
<A HREF="classoomph_1_1AxisymmetricNavierStokesSlipElement.html"> AxisymmetricNavierStokesSlipElement</A>s are used to impose the slip condition. 
On the diagonal boundary, \f$S_2\f$, we have no penetration and pure slip, or equivalently, a tangential stress free condition.
\f[{u} \cdot {n}                 = 0 , {t} \cdot {\tau} \cdot {n}  = 0.\f]
Again, <A HREF="classoomph_1_1ImposeImpenetrabilityElement.html"> ImposeImpenetrabilityElement</A>s are used to impose the no penetration condition.

On the curved far field boundary, \f$S_1\f$, we employ the natural boundary condition to give a free stress constraint,
\f[ {\tau} \cdot {n}  = 0.\f]
The pressure at the top of the sector is set to zero, at \f$x = 0, z = R\f$,
\f[p = 0.\f]
