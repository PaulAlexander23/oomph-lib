# Installation instructions

Full installation instructions may be found on the
[`oomph-lib` homepage](http://www.oomph-lib.org).

Briefly, `oomph-lib`s top-level directory contains a shell script [autogen.sh](autogen.sh)
   which guides the user through the installation procedure and suggests
   sensible defaults for various configure/installation options.
   We highly recommend using this script to perform the installation.
