Upgraded python scripts in scalapack installer to python3, using 2to3 and
some additional tweaks applied with plenty of hand-holding from Puneet.
When scalapack is being built these modified files overwrite the ones
contained in the scalapack tar file.

  Careful: scalapack.log is also scanned to extract some build information
 for the subsequent mumps installation, particularly information about
 mangling, so adding debug statements to the python scripts can have
 unintended consequences (as I found out).

To compare the modified files against the original ones:

  cd external_distributions/mumps_and_scalapack/scalapack_python3_scripts/
  mkdir junk
  cp scalapack_installer.tgz junk/
  cd junk/
  tar xvfz scalapack_installer.tgz 
  cd scalapack_installer_0.94/script/
  find . -name '*.py' -exec meld {} ../../../scalapack_python3_scripts/{} \;


(The last command assumes you have meld; use diff, sdiff or any other
file comparison code on your machine if you don't.)
  
Note that test are bypassed to allow for cross-compilation (where the OS on
the building machine is different from the one where code is executed); this
was a problem on Hector. Python code is hacked by replacing the relevant
command with "date".
